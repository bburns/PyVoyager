# framerates.csv
# Slowdown/speed up movies for specific image ranges
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This file does NOT need to be sorted, since it's all read into a dictionary
# at the moment.

# nframes is the number of frames to show each image -
# the default is 1, anything higher slows the movie down that amount -
# must be an integer.

# The main frame rate is set in config.py - config.movieFrameRate.
# These values are all based on a frame rate of 25fps.

# Can set 'sticky' overrides by appending a '+' to the imageId -
# the frame rate will stick for that target until turned off with a '-',
# at which point the standard framerate calculations will resume.
# eg
# c1238432+,4
# c1239382,1
# c1239399-

# the best way i've found to make this file is to run vg target ___,
# then look through the images in the targets folder.
# move all the bad frames to another folder, eg desktop/removethese.
# then, set the first image to C123456+,1
# then highlight any cool frames with C123456,25 or something
# then select all the image files in the removethese folder
# and copy them, then can paste them into this editor and it'll paste the filenames.
# eg C123456,0
# so replace the ,0 with ,0 to remove that image
# then select all those image rows and sort ascending
# then run vg clips or vg movies
