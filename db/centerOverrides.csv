# centerOverrides.csv
# this file would be used to correct any mis-centered images
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# program will check here first for a match, then centers.csv

# this file DOES need to be sorted to join against files.csv

# either that, or mark manually overridden values in centers.csv file so they don't get overwritten.
# but would be hard to remember to do that

#. a cmd could remove records from here when the autocentering algo improves enough to duplicate them

#. don't really need radius - get that from positions.csv
