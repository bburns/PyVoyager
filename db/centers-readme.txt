the centers.csv file stores the x,y offset for each image

it's added to when you run the vg center command

then you need to sort it ascending, and commit it to the repo

the columns are fileId,volume,x,y,radius,notes

can use the notes column to add notes, specify to keep manual overrides etc

eg

C3497616,6113,305,672,35,shifted left a bit
