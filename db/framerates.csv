# framerates.csv
# Slowdown/speed up movies for specific image ranges
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This file does NOT need to be sorted, since it's all read into a dictionary
# at the moment.

# nframes is the number of frames to show each image -
# the default is 1, anything higher slows the movie down that amount -
# must be an integer.

# The main frame rate is set in config.py - config.movieFrameRate.
# These values are all based on a frame rate of 25fps.

# Can set 'sticky' overrides by appending a '+' to the imageId -
# the frame rate will stick for that target until turned off with a '-',
# at which point the standard framerate calculations will resume.
